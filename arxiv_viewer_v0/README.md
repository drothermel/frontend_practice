# Arxiv Viewer

This is an app that shows how you can display the results from the [Dummy Json API](https://dummyjson.com/) (so easy) and then how you can query and parse the results from the arxiv api.

Additionally the arxiv page allows for querying with an author and the retrieved results bold the name of the author whose name is in the input field.

**PRs:**
- [PR 7: Arxiv Viewer V0 | Interact with the Arxiv API](https://github.com/drothermel/frontend_practice/pull/7)

**Note:** A Cleaner impl of this is available in `db_auth_tables` from [PR 15: Arxiv API JSON & Table Viewers + Add to Library](https://github.com/drothermel/frontend_practice/pull/15)
