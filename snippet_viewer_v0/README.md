# Snippet Viewer v0: Save Using Context API

Created two components, a Snippet Input and a Snippet Library (but called Morsels because Snippet is a reserved word in Svelte). Additionally created a page that displayed the components in two resizable panes.

The snippets can be added and deleted, and the data is being stored via the ContextAPI for now.

Next Step: switch from storing in the context API to storing in a database!
