# Svedit Editor

Created an editor based on [Svedit](https://github.com/michael/svedit/tree/main) that supports nested blocks that can be added, removed and editted.  The final version enables editting via markdown & has very "under development" toolbars.

Currently nothing is saved but besides that its usable as of now.
